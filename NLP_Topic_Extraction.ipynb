      "     Donald Trump may be a federal employee now, but fellow government workers wonât be getting discounts at his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel  â   even if the hotelâs website promises otherwise. Scroll through the offers on the Trump International Hotelâs website and youâll see a section advertising special government rates, currently capped at $182 per night by the General Services Administration. âIt is our pleasure to welcome Retired and Active Duty members of the United States Military and Armed Forces,â the page reads. But good luck getting one of those discounted rates.    A screengrab of the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. website.  The booking calendar shows âno availabilityâ for government employees and military members from now through the end of February 2018, which is as far as the calendar goes.    The hotelâs website shows âno availabilityâ for government and military discounts for the next year, as seen in this screenshot.  âUnfortunately weâre not offering government rates at this time,â an employee on the hotelâs reservation desk said on the phone. âItâs still being worked out at this time. â The hotelâs âsenior discount promotion,â meanwhile, where rates start at $437, is available every day through February 2018, according to the booking calendar. A spokeswoman for the Trump hotel did not respond to requests for comment. Advertising and legal experts said the hotel could be in violation of federal and District laws prohibiting false and misleading advertising. âBy definition, this is false advertising,â said Bruce Silverman, a longtime advertising executive who serves as an expert witness in false advertising cases. âIf someone  â   say, a service person  â   was to go to the website or call in to secure this rate and was told, âWell we really donât have that rate,â they could file a complaint or sue the hotel. â Trumpâs team spent more than $200 million transforming the Old Post Office Pavilion from a federal landmark to a luxury hotel. The Trump Organization has a   lease for the building, which is owned by the General Services Administration. âThe irony of course is that it is a federal building and it is probably the most convenient hotel for the greatest number of federal agencies,â said Brett Sterenson, president of Hotel Lobbyists, a conference site selection firm in the District, whose clients include the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. âItâs right there, between Constitution Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. â The Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency are next door to the $212 million hotel. The Justice Department, U. S. Customs and Border Protection and the U. S. Postal Service also have offices nearby.   [Mr. Trump, meet your new neighbors: The EPA and the IRS]   The federal government sets night   rates for employees and members of the military every year. In the Washington area, that rate ranges from $172 to $242, depending on the month. Nationally, the nightly rate can be as little as $91, depending on the city, Sterenson said. âWashington has some of the highest federal per diem rates in the entire nation,â Sterenson said. âBut even then itâll always be a challenge to find   rates at the most elite hotels. â Even so, a number of other   hotels in downtown Washington, including the Four Seasons, J. W. Marriott, Marriott Marquis and Fairmont, all had $182 government and military rates available this month. Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said he didnât see any ethical reasons the hotel couldnât offer government or military discounts. âHe shouldnât be owning a hotel for a whole bunch of reasons,â Painter said. âThe ethics problem is using that hotel as a place where people go schmooze government officials.  Thatâs the big issue, not what kind of rate they charge government workers. â Special offers at Trump hotels are as varied as the properties themselves. The Trump International Hotel in Chicago is advertising a Mancation Package (âNeed time away with the boys? ,â starting at $695 per night) while the Trump New Yorkâs Glamping by the Park offer comes with a tent, simulated campfire and sâmores kit (starting at $1, 475 per night). And as for those hoping to visit Washington, the Trump Internationalâs Rise and Dine package is still up for grabs. For a starting nightly rate of $495, guests are promised breakfast for two. âEnjoy unparalleled views of Washington D. C. skyline while indulging in pain au chocolate and the finest cuisine in Washington,â the site says. Read more: Conspicuously missing from Donald Trumpâs new hotel venture: His name D. C. hotels were expecting an inaugural booking frenzy. Instead theyâve got vacancies. âThe only problem is that Trump has his name on it,â meeting planners say of hotel\n",

      " U. S. consumer spending cooled in January as demand for automobiles and utilities fell, but inflation recorded its biggest monthly increase in four years, raising the probability of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this month. The tepid gain in consumer spending added to weak housing starts, equipment spending and construction data in suggesting economic growth remained moderate early in the first quarter after slowing in the final three months of 2016. Despite the softness on the   of the economy, the manufacturing sector recovery is gaining steam. Factory activity hit a     high in February, other data showed on Wednesday. âA weak start to the year for consumers suggests a downside risk to   growth prospects, though it likely wonât quell recent chatter about a March Fed rate hike,â said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than   of U. S. economic activity, increased 0. 2 percent after rising 0. 5 percent in December. Consumer spending is likely to remain supported amid promises by the Trump administration of sweeping tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending. In a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump said his economic team was working on a âhistoricâ tax reform that would slash corporate taxes. Trump promised  âmassiveâ tax cuts for the middle class, but offered no further details. Consumer confidence has surged following Trumpâs Nov. 8 election victory, hitting a     high in February.       In January the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0. 4 percent   the largest gain since February 2013   after rising 0. 2 percent in December.  In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index jumped 1. 9 percent. That was the biggest    gain since October 2012 and followed a 1. 6 percent increase in December.  Excluding food and energy, the   core PCE price index rose 0. 3 percent in January. That was the biggest increase since January 2012 and followed a 0. 1 percent gain in December.  The core PCE price index increased 1. 7 percent    after a similar gain in December. The core PCE is the Fedâs  preferred inflation measure.  While still below the U. S. central bankâs 2 percent target, inflation is now in the upper end of the range that Fed officials in December estimated would be reached this year. âCOMPELLINGâ CASE FOR RATE HIKE      The strong inflation readings come a day after New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for further monetary policy tightening had become a âlot more compelling.â Prices for U. S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the   sensitive   note US2YT=RR hitting its highest level since August 2009. Fed funds futures were pricing in about a 65 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fedâs March   policy meeting. The dollar touched a   high against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average   breaching the 21, 000 mark for the first time ever as investors focused on Trumpâs comments. The U. S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December.  In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 57. 7 last month, the highest since August 2014, from 56. 0 in January.  A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U. S. economy. Some of the increase likely reflects a surge in business confidence following Trumpâs election. But that has not been matched by a strong increase in business spending on capital goods. Business spending on equipment rose moderately in the fourth quarter and appeared to weaken in January, data showed this week. âFor now, businesses and households appear confident, but have yet to act on that confidence,â said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. âWhen it comes to calculating GDP it is the hard data that matters, and so far the hard activity data for the first quarter has been disappointing.â Rising inflation is eroding consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0. 3 percent in January, the first drop since August and the biggest in three years. It increased 0. 3 percent in December and Januaryâs drop implies  consumer spending will probably not provide a big boost to GDP in the first quarter Consumer spending increased at a 3. 0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to blunt some of the impact on the economy from a wider trade deficit.  The economy grew at a 1. 9 percent rate in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 1. 8 percent pace this quarter. Another report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed construction spending declined 1. 0 percent in January. Personal income rose 0. 4 percent in January after gaining 0. 3 percent in December. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation, fell 0. 2 percent, the first decline since October 2013.
