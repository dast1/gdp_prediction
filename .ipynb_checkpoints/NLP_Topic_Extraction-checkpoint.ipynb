      " Donald Trump went on CNBC this morning, and, over the course of a   interview, once again reminded the world of the most fundamental fact about his candidacy: He doesnât really seem to understand any aspect of American public policy.    Benefiting as he often does from a cable news format, he was allowed to ramble and dissemble across a variety of topics  â   including who sets interest rates, how monetary policy impacts the economy, and how his own money is invested, finding time for a racist personal attack against a rival politician. âI believe itâs a false market,â Trump said of the current state of American stocks. âI donât even invest in the stock market.â Trumpâs personal financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission have been fairly skimpy given the complicated nature of his finances, but they clearly show that he does in fact own millions of dollars in stock.    What he thinks is false about the market is that he believes stock prices would fall if the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. He also thinks Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be âashamedâ of what sheâs doing to the country with her low interest rate policy. Trump then offered the theory that this is all being done to somehow help out President Obama.      forget  : Trump on @CNBC says Obama is keeping interest rates down, leaving it to âthe new guyâ in WH to raise them next January\r",
      "  â   John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) September 12, 2016    Versions of this kind of theory are pretty common in business circles, since business circles feature a lot of affluent white men who are generally   toward the Democratic Party, but it doesnât make any sense. After all, the way low interest rates are allegedly helping Obama is by improving economic conditions. But improving economic conditions is what the Fed is supposed to do. Why would it be ashamed? Then for good measure, Trump called Elizabeth Warren âPocahontas.â      On CNBC, Donald Trump casually calls Sen. Elizabeth Warren âPocahontasâ while discussing interest rates.\r",
      "  â   Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) September 12, 2016    A few observations about all this:  In a normal election cycle, a candidate making an offhand racist remark about a sitting US senator would be a big news story. In a normal election cycle, a candidate saying an offhanded lie about the state of his personal finances would be a big news story.  To be totally honest, even in a normal election cycle a candidate exhibiting total confusion about the mechanics and merits of monetary policy probably wouldnât be that big of a news story, but it would at least get some attention.   Seriously. Stop. Take a breath. Now imagine if Mitt Romney had run exactly Mitt Romneyâs campaign but then suddenly in   went on television and called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas for no reason. It would have been huge. This year, basically nothing. Trump being kinda racist is a    story. After all, just yesterday Donald Trump Jr. shared a white nationalist meme on Instagram. Trump lies all the time, so thatâs not a big deal. In fact, he lies frequently about the essential core of his foreign policy, and his business dealings pose such obvious and flagrant conflicts of interest and ethics problems that lying about his stock holdings doesnât seem like a big deal. And of course Trump doesnât understand what heâs saying when it comes to monetary policy  â   monetary policy is complicated and obscure, and Trump doesnât know what heâs talking about on any other issue either.   odd comment on @NewDay from Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn re: TPP this AM (China isnât a party in the deal) pic. twitter. \r",
      "  â   Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 12, 2016    Separately, one of Trumpâs top policy advisers went on CNN this morning to denounce âthis whole, you know,   trade agreement with China.â    The   Partnership is not a trade agreement with China. It includes 12 countries, and none of them is China. The whole thing makes me nostalgic for the days when I would complain that political coverage was too focused on candidate gaffes rather than policy ideas. Trump has no policy ideas, so thereâs really nothing to focus on. You could spend all day trying to explain why various utterances donât really make sense, but if heâs putting advisers out on television to denounce an entirely fake trade agreement with China, pointing out that heâs also getting the finer points wrong hardly seems worth our time. The best we can hope for is that Trumpâs actual gaffes do get covered. But the truly scary thing is that Trump is redefining the concept of a gaffe out of existence. It turns out that if you just boldly repeat something often enough, it goes away as a story. Weâve become numb, as a society, to what Trump is doing. In the process weâve normalized casual racism and intense personal insults as an approach to politics, and completely decentered the idea that elected officials should grapple with difficult policy questions. Half the crazy things Trump says or does barely merit a mention on Twitter, much less the   coverage they would have merited in previous campaigns. More than anything else, the numbness that Trump creates frightens me. We have a learned a lot this year about what you can get away with in politics if you are brazen enough. The answer is that you can get away with a lot. Whatever happens in November, that revelation wonât go away.  Watch: Donald Trump hates lies, but canât tell the truth    \n",

      " Woe is Brazil. As August s Summer Olympics approach, Latin America s largest country  â with a population of 206Ã million and an economy that is 40 percent of the region s total  â is caught in a harsh slump and faces a political crisis that could result in its president being impeached. How did this happen? What does it mean? A decade ago, Brazil was a poster child for  emerging market ? countries whose surging economies would ultimately make them wealthy nations. Remember BRIC: The acronym stood for  Brazil, Russia, India, China, ? which were the anointed leaders. From 2004 to 2008, Brazil s economy averaged growth of almost 5Ã percent a year, reports the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.   Robert J. Samuelson writes a weekly column on economics. View Archive   No more. Economist Rafael Amiel of IHS, a consulting company, reports that the country s economy has been shrinking since 2014 and that he expects cumulative decline of gross domestic product  â total output  â to be 8. 5Ã percent. That s roughly twice the GDP drop (4. 2Ã percent) the United States suffered in the Great Recession. Brazil s national unemployment rate has risen from 6. 7Ã percent in   to 9. 5Ã percent at the end of 2015. It will probably go higher. Some of the slump stems from the collapse of commodity prices. Brazil is a major exporter of raw materials, including iron ore, soybeans, oil and coffee.  But the bigger part of the story is macroeconomic mismanagement, ? says Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist at the Peterson Institute, a think tank.    With Brazil s president and her predecessor embroiled in a growing corruption scandal, supporters of the governing Workers  Party took to the streets in rallies Friday and were joined by sympathizers arguing that recent escalations in the investigation threaten their young democracy. Correction: An earlier version of this video said that Brazilâs President Dilma Rousseff is under investigation. She is not. Her predecessor Luiz Ã InÃÂ¡cio Lula da Silva is. (Whitney Leaming, Thomas   Washington Post)   To bolster the reelection of President Dilma Rousseff in 2014  â the allegation goes  â credit was kept cheap, and government spending and deficits expanded. Now those policies have been reversed to check the adverse side effects. The budget deficit, which had been running 2Ã to 3Ã percent of GDP, ballooned to 10Ã percent in 2015. Inflation reached nearly 11Ã percent last year, says the rating agency Moody s. Interest rates have been raised and spending squeezed.  The accusation against Rousseff  â the grounds for impeachment  â is that she hid the   of the budget deficit through various gimmicks. She denies it. A  yes ? vote in the Brazilian Congress s lower house would trigger a Senate trial, unless she resigns. Compounding public outrage is a vast scandal involving Petrobras, the national oil company. Petrobras has estimated the cost of bribes and rigged construction bids at $3 billion. Dozens of executives and public officials have been implicated. In March, 3Ã million or more Brazilians demonstrated to protest the Petrobras scandal and Rousseff.  No one knows where this mix of economic disappointment and political disillusion is leading. One hopeful possibility is that Brazil s casual tolerance of graft may be fading, speculates Paulo Sotero, a veteran Brazilian journalist who now heads the Brazil Institute in Washington. He cites one poll in which nine of 10 Brazilians want the Petrobras prosecutions to continue even if they hurt the economy.   A change of attitude toward corruption [may be] under way, ? he writes.  The passivity that was once expected of law enforcement officials . â°. â°. is a thing of the past. ?  But for now, political and economic dysfunction feed on each other. Political turmoil saps confidence, which weakens the economy and deepens political discontent.  Businesses are delaying investment, even of replacing   equipment, ? says economist Amiel of IHS. Changing economic policy will be difficult. As in the United States, reducing big budget deficits is unpopular. Many Brazilians retire by 55, says de Bolle; social security s eligibility age should be raised to 65. Much social spending is uncontrolled, because the constitution requires that it increase with inflation or tax collections. These restrictions should be relaxed, she says. Similarly, the role of state banks  â which flood the economy with subsidized credit  â should be curbed. What Brazil teaches is that the promise of  emerging market ? countries was often wishful thinking. The presumption was that these countries, especially the BRICs, would inexorably narrow the gap with advanced societies. They would adopt known technologies, expand their education systems and improve local management. What got lost in this simplistic vision was the impact of national differences  â of values, institutions, politics, policies  â on smooth economic growth.  With details changed, Brazil s experience mirrors what s happened in China and many   countries. Contrary to hopes after the   financial crisis, these countries have not been sufficiently dynamic to serve as a  locomotive ? for the rest of the world, replacing advanced nations. Brazil is important in its own right. But it is also part of the larger story of why the world economy has struggled.   Read more from Robert Samuelson s archive.

      "Hong Kong: Asian markets saw fresh volatility Wednesday, with Shanghai seeing sharp swings, as weak factory activity data highlighted weakness in the global economy but fuelled hopes central banks will stick to a loose monetary policy.The euro also held its own after rallying in New York as a surprisingly positive set of eurozone figures raised the possibility the European Central Bank will delay an expected stimulus boost.Official figures showing a gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity hit a three-year low in November was followed later in the day by news that US factory work contracted at the fastest pace since June 2009.While the US economy, the world´s biggest, has shown strong signs it is well on track to recovery, traders remain nervous about the future, with commodity prices at multi-year lows and the dollar soaring, hitting exports.\"Traditionally, the manufacturing sector has been the canary in the coal mine when it comes to slowing growth. To what extent does this bleed over into other sectors of the economy -- that´s yet to be seen,\" Brett Ryan, a US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, told Bloomberg News.All three main indexes on Wall Street ended higher as investors bet that an expected increase in interest rates will be slow and gradual.In Asia, markets shifted in and out of positive territory. Shanghai was 0.1 percent lower after surging more than one percent at one point.- Eurozone boost -The benchmark index rose Monday and Tuesday, having plunged 5.5 percent at the end of last week on news that several top brokerages were being investigated as part of a crackdown after the summer´s market rout.However, the International Monetary Fund´s decision to include the yuan in its special drawing rights basket of elite currencies has provided some buying support.On currency markets talk of a slow rise in US rates weighed on the dollar, which retreated in New York to $1.0634 from $1.0566 and to 122.86 yen from 123.09 yen.The euro was also given support by data showing factory growth in the eurozone picked up the pace last month while unemployment tumbled, fuelling hopes the bloc is slowly recovering.The EU´s Eurostat agency said unemployment in the 19-country region fell to 10.7 percent in October, the best reading since January 2012. In Germany the rate sank to its lowest level since the country´s reunification in 1990.Dealers are awaiting a European Central Bank policy meeting this week to see if it ramps up its stimulus programme or, in light of the latest report, stands pat until the new year.Sydney stocks slipped despite a slight pick-up in the Australian economy in the July-September quarter, which Treasurer Scott Morrison said showed progress in shifting from a resources-fuelled boom to broader-based growth.- Key figures around 0300 GMT -Tokyo - Nikkei 225: down 0.1 percent at 20,002.12 (break)Shanghai - composite: DOWN 0.1 percent 3,452.12Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.2 percent at 22,427.61Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0620 from $1.0634 late TuesdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.95 yen from 122.86 yenNew York - Dow: UP 1.0 percent at 17,888.35 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.6 percent at 6,395.65 (close)                        \r\n",
